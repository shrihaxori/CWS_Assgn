# Non Uniform Sampling: Reconstruction, Methods, and Applications

## Introduction
Hola Guys, Welcome to the Non Uniform Sampling project repository! This project was done as a part of course work of DA623: Computing with Signals.

This project aims to provide an understanding of non-uniform sampling, its reconstruction methods, and various applications.
Sampling is a crucial concept in signal processing, where discrete-time signals are obtained from continuous-time signals. Traditional sampling methods, such as uniform sampling, assume that samples are taken at regular intervals. However, in many real-world scenarios, non-uniform sampling is more practical and efficient.
